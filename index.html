            <p>I was born in Dayton. I went to the P and then USAFA. I went to tech school in Biloxi. I am currently stationed in the Springs.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dayton, Ohio <span>I was born here in 1994 18 years after my mom moved here from the south.</span></li>
              <li>USAFA, Colorado <span>I was recruited to come here to place football for the Huskies and the Falcons. Best decision of my life thus far.</span></li>
              <li>Biloxi, Mississippi <span>After failing one class at the Academy (Computer Science), the Air Force decided I should become a communications officer. Tech school was at Keesler AFB. Honestly, one of the best decisions made for me.</span></li>
              <li>Colorado Springs, Colorado <span>My wife lead us back to the Springs after she was picked for her assignment at Peterson before me. I love it here, but it's time to move on to something new</span></li>
